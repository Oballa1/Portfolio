            <p>Hey there! My name is Steve ObalaðŸ‘‹
                Why did the web developer go broke?<br>
                Because he used up all his cache!
                But don't worry, I promise my jokes are the only thing outdated about my skills. ðŸ˜„</p>
                <p><h3>Background</h3><br>I am a kisumu local, born and raised. I am currently a student @Moringa school taking a hybrid course on Software engineering<br>
                    .I was interested in tech from a very young age,<br>
                    but what really set me on this path, was when i learned how much a software engineer earns.<br> 
                    Selfish right? but trust me if you don't do it for the passion do it for the money, it pays.
                    <br> In my free time I like to hit the gym, get in a workout maybe play basketball, where I am a shooting guard for southB jets.<br>
                    I am also a foodie who enjoys trying new restaurants. basically anything fun count me in.<br>
